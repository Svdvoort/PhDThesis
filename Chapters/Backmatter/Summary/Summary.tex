In recent years, automated image analysis and machine learning methods quickly gained popularity in the medical imaging field.
In tandem with the introduction of radiomics, where features are extracted from biomedical imaging data and correlated with disease characteristics, these methods have had a significant impact on biomedical imaging research and are slowly finding its way into the clinic.
In this thesis, I developed several automated image analysis and machine learning methods to aid in the analysis of glioma \gls{MRI} scans.

\textbf{\cref{chap:introduction}} introduces the current clinical understanding and management of glioma.
It focusses on the role that a glioma's genetic features play in the aggressiveness and treatment response of the \gls{tumor}, and the importance of these genetic features in the clinical decision making.
In this chapter, I also introduce the current role of biomedical imaging in the clinical management of glioma.

In \textbf{\cref{chap:radiomics}}, I provide a general introduction to automated image analysis and machine learning methods.
I explain the methodology underlying several machine learning techniques and discuss the importance and potential pitfalls of setting up an adequately executed radiomics study.
The chapter also discusses infrastructure resources that researchers can use to efficiently carry out radiomics experiments.

In \textbf{\cref{chap:LGGLocation}}, I used MRI data from 224 \gls{LGG} patients to find a relationship between the location of a \gls{tumor} and its genetic features.
I found that \gls{IDH}-mutated \gls{LGG} are more frequently located in the frontal lobes and \gls{IDH}-wildtype \gls{LGG} are more frequently located in the basal ganglia of the right hemisphere.
\Glspl{tumor} that showed 9p loss were more frequently located in the left parietal lobes.
For other genetic features, such as the 1p/19q co-deletion status, no significant association with the \gls{tumor} location was found.
I also found that \glspl{tumor} with total resection or a small post-operative volume were predominantly located in the frontal lobes.

In \textbf{\cref{chap:HGGLocation}}, I used \gls{MRI} data from 435 \gls{IDH}-wildtype \gls{HGG} patients to find a relationship between the \gls{tumor} location and the \gls{MGMT} methylation status of the glioma.
A visual inspection found that \gls{MGMT} unmethylated glioma were more frequently located in the bifrontal and left occipital periventricular areas and less frequently near the right occipital periventricular area.
However, further analysis did not find a significant relationship between the \gls{tumor} localization and the \gls{MGMT} methylation status.

In \textbf{\cref{chap:LGG1p19q}}, I developed a radiomics method that predicts the 1p/19q status of non-enhancing \gls{LGG} using a \gls{SVM} using pre-operative \gls{MRI} scans.
\gls{MRI} scans from 284 patients were used to develop the method, and an independent dataset of 129 patients was used to evaluate the method.
This method was successful in predicting the 1p/19q status and outperformed two out of four clinical experts that performed the same task.
Analysis of the radiomics method showed that it mainly used imaging features that were previously described in the literature as the basis of its predictions.

In \textbf{\cref{chap:DDS}}, I focused on the problem of using unstructured, large-scale data for biomedical imaging research.
In this chapter, I proposed a method, based on a convolutional neural network, that can automatically predict the contrast type of brain \gls{MRI} scans.
The method was trained using 11065 \gls{MRI} scans of 719 glioma patients and tested on 2369 scans of 192 glioma patients.
It was also tested on 7227 scans of 1318 Alzheimer patients, to show the generalizability of our method to \gls{MRI} scans that do not contain brain \glspl{tumor}.
Our method was able to predict the contrast type of the scan with near-perfect accuracy for both the glioma patients and the Alzheimer patients.
Based on the predicted scan type, our method can quickly structure a dataset, providing a tremendous speed-up compared to the manual sorting of these datasets.

In \textbf{\cref{chap:prognosais}}, I developed a method that can simultaneously segment glioma and predict their \gls{IDH}-status, 1p/19q-status, and grade using pre-operative \gls{MRI} scans.
By predicting these genetic and histological features, a \gls{tumor} can be categorized according to the \gls{WHO} 2016 guidelines.
This method was based on an existing convolutional neural network architecture, which was altered to enable the multiple, simultaneous predictions.
By optimizing the model, I was able to use the full 3D \gls{MRI} scan as an input.
Furthermore, this method worked on all types of glioma, regardless of their clinical characteristics or visual appearance.
This method was developed using a dataset of 1508 glioma patients and tested on an independent dataset of 240 patients.
The method achieved good performance for all of the different tasks, demonstrating the possibilities of using a single method for multiple tasks.

Finally, in \textbf{\cref{chap:discussion}}, I discuss the contributions of this thesis towards the improvement of the image analysis of glioma.
Although there are still barriers to overcome before automated image analysis and machine learning methods will be ingrained in the clinic, there is a clear potential for these methods to contribute in the clinical management of glioma in a significant way.
