\chapter{Introduction}

When genetic changes occur during the production of new cells the cells can start to grow uncontrollably, this process is commonly known as cancer.
These uncontrollable cells might then go on to form a single mass, a tumor.
Tumors can originate from and occur almost everywhere in the human body, with one of the deadliest being brain tumors.
Different subtypes of brain tumors are recognized, depending on their origin.
In this thesis, we focus on glioma, a specific subtype of brain tumors which originate from the glial cells in the brain and the most often occurring brain tumor \autocite{leece2017indicence}.

Although glioma have a low incidence, around \per{1.71} globally \autocite{leece2017indicence}, they are quite lethal with median survival of around 10 months \autocite{hess2004gliomaincidence}.
Treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy help to prolong the life expectancy of brain tumor patients, and in some cases remove the tumor.
However, the severity and impact of a glioma differ from which with some patients dying within XX months, but others surviving up to XX years.


\gls{MRI} uses the property of the water molecules of tissue to form an image, by manipulating these properties, different tissue characteristics can be imaged.
These concept is often used in clinical care, mainly to distinguish healthy tissue from diseased tissue.
Shortly after the first introduction of \gls{MRI}, it was proposed that the method could be used to identify tumors \autocite{damadian1971tumor}.
After some improvements, the technique was first applied to the brain in 1980 \autocite{holland1980brain}, and in the same year MRI has first been used to investigate a possible tumor in the brain, shown in \cref{fig:intro_MR_first} \autocite{hawkes1980NMRbrain}.
Since then quality of \gls{MRI} scans has vastly increased, and different \gls{MRI} techniques have been developed that image different tissue characteristics.
\cref{fig:intro_MR_modern} shows a modern \gls{MR} image of a brain tumor.
Here the tumor can clearly be seen in the patients brain, and therefore MRI is now the standard-of-care for brain tumor diagnosis and treatment decisions.
